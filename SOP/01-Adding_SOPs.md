# SOP01 - Adding SOPs

## Short description

This SOP gives indication on how an employee will decide if creating a new SOP, which information to look for and the steps involved in adding a new SOP.

## Pre-requisites
Before commiting to creating a new SOP, you must make sure that no exisiting SOP already covers the situation you are dealing with. 

You must have a Github account with editor permission on the company's reposiitory to be able to create SOPs.

## Procedure
1. Give yourself some time to think about the problem you are trying to capture. Make sure you have a good understanding of it, the requirements, prerequisites and expected outcomes for that situation.
2. Copy the SOP template from the ´0_templates´  folder into the ´SOP´ folder and rename it to XX-Name_of_SOP.
3. Write the SOP, going step by step with the proposed solution.
4. After writing it, take a walk, make yourself a cup of coffee, and come back fresh.
5. Read the whole SOP trying hard to put yourself in a situation of someone who needs this SOP but has not written it. Is it clear? Does it address the problem? Do you spot steps that need to be rearranged, removed, or added? Is there a hint of a bigger problem lurking, not encapsulated in the SOP?
6. After the intent and solution is clear and satisfactory, fix typos, grammar and minor writing details.
7. Commit the changes to the repository and make a pull request.
